# experiments

A catch all repository for my programming experiments. This repository exists for **educational and recreational purposes only.**

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently intended for experienced developers. Detailed setup and usage instructions are not provided, as users are expected to:
>
> - Be familiar with low-level build systems and development tooling.
> - Manage dependencies and platform-specific configurations independently.
>
> This **may** change in future releases, but for now, the codebase assumes advanced technical proficiency.
