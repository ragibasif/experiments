# experiments

A catch all repository for my programming experiments C. This repository exists for educational and recreational purposes only.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently intended for experienced programmers only. As such, detailed building/running instructions are not provided. Users are expected to:
>
> - Understand C toolchains (compiler, linker, etc.).
> - Handle dependencies and platform-specific configurations independently.
>
> This **may** change in future releases, but for now, the codebase assumes technical proficiency.
